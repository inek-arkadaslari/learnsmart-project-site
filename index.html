        EduxAI is a web application designed to enhance students' academic
        performance through advanced learning tools. By incorporating
        technologies such as LLMs, EduxAI helps students grasp course materials
        more thoroughly by offering explanations on a page-by-page or holistic
        basis for study resources like textbooks, slides, and syllabi.
        Interactive features like flashcards, quizzes, and custom study
        schedules help students stay organized and improve retention. EduxAI
        will also offer statistics that will help students analyze their work;
        for example, from the time that students took the course, a graph of
        overall success will be displayed. Moreover, recharge tests based on
        what the student has done wrong will be recommended to the student.
        Moreover, features include a skill tree model, which generates
        subject-based skill trees that evolve as students complete quizzes, and
        a report-project checker that verifies the alignment of reports with
        projects using data from public GitHub repositories. EduxAI will be an
        extensive framework integrating multiple tools, including the skill tree
        and report-project checker, to support student learning.
